# Project - Web Programming with Python

:star: Remember to gather PDA evidence :star:

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Python
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper other than SQLAlchemy (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

All of these will be covered later in the course. Do not make any attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits. The number of commits in your final submission is one of the criteria your work will be judged on.

## Briefs

The briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

Your code will be reviewed with an instructor on Thursday afternoon.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Thursday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code problem that you solved
* Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?

## Attendance

Please come in on Monday so we can do 1-1s if necessary.

## PDA Reminder:

As part of this project you are required to take screenshots of the following:

```
- A Use Case Diagram  
- A Class diagram  
- An Object diagram  
- An Activity Diagram
- A user sitemap
- Two wireframe designs
- An example of pseudocode for a function
- One of your projects where you have worked alone and attach the Github link
```

Show user input being processed according to design requirements. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user inputting something into your program
- The user input being saved or used in some way
```

Show an interaction with data persistence. Take a screenshot of:

```
- Data being inputted into your program
- Confirmation of the data being saved
```

Show the correct output of results and feedback to user. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user requesting information or an action to be performed
- The user request being processed correctly and demonstrated in the program
```

Produce an Implementations Constraints plan detailing the following factors:

```
 - Hardware and software platforms
 - Performance requirements
 - Persistent storage and transactions
 - Usability
 - Budgets
 - Time   
```

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to Canvas
